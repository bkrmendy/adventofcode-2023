# This Year I Learned

### Day 1
There can be edge cases even on day 1

### Day 4
Got some practice with the mutable arrays boilerplate

### Day 6
TODO: check how the quadratic formula was derived (the solution still
uses a direct enumeration)

### Day 8
The quick `lcm` bid worked, but only because the input allowed it. TYIL:
try the quick and easy solution before going on the full-fledged on (which
would have been the Chinese remainder theorem)

### Day 10
TODO: what are winding numbers?

### Day 11
- it's worth considering whether a problem can be decomposed into its constituent
  dimensions (rows and columns in this case)
- "symbolic representations win"

### Day 12
Started out with a very fun logic programming-style solution, which helped a lot with
debugging, but was too memory-hungry, so ultimately it had to be dropped. Caching worked
because the ends of the lists the "shared sub-problems".  

TODO: recreate the original implementation

### Day 17
Implemented Dijkstra search from scratch, better late than never

### Day 18
TODO: shoelace + pick's

### Day 20
Looking at the input is as important as looking at the problem description

### Day 21
- TODO: deriving the quadratic formula
- TODO: implement Hashlife

### Day 22
Lack of sleep makes you dumber

### Day 24
z3 + SBV (to a degree)

### Day 25
put it in graphviz
